The message "Buffer beyond capacity" will be printed if buffer.size() is greater than capacity. 

This happens because if multiple producer threads are accessing the produce method without synchronization,
two threads may both pass the buffer.size() >= capacity check before adding an item. This can result in both
threads adding items simultaneously, leading the buffer size to exceed the defined capacity.

"System.err.println("id " + id + ": retrieved null. error");" This message is printed if multiple consumer 
threads are accessing consume concurrently and the buffer is empty, each thread can call buffer.poll(),
which returns null when the buffer is empty. 

I solve this problem by adding locks to both the produce and the consume method in the shared buffer, 
ensuring that only one thread modifies the buffer at a time.
